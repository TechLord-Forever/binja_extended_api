# Binary Ninja Extended API plugin

The Extended API plugin provides an interface for interacting with Binary Ninja's GUI. See the [documentation](https://binary-ninja-extended-api.readthedocs.io/) for details.

## Requirements

  * PyQt5 must be installed and functional in Binary Ninja.
  * Right now, the plugin only works on Linux; a macOS port should be trivial, a Windows port
    is fundamentally impossible (did anyone get PyQt5 to work with Binary Ninja on Windows anyway?)
